-- 1 React Intro --
	- shift from class-based components to function-based stateless components
	
	
	React: JS library for building user interface
		- 2 main scripts that come with React
			1) "react" script
				- builds virtual DOM
				- describes all the UI components in app
				
			2) "react-dom" script
				- converts virtual DOM to actual HTML components on page
			
			* When people talk about React, it involves these 2 scripts
			
	ReactNative: 
		- "react" script & "react-native" script
		- converts virtual DOM to native components for ios & android 
		
	

== Starting React Project ==
	- Can use CDN but recommended to create react project

	1) Create empty directory for project
	2) npx create-react-app <projectDirName> --use-npm | --use-yarn (optional flag)
		- name usually called react-app
		- generates: "react", "react-dom", "react-scripts"
		- "react-scripts": To help run dev / prod build for project
			- gives webpack | babel | jest (for testing)
				- webpack : JS Module Bundler, bundle JS files for use in browser
				- babel : JS compiler to ensure compatibility with older browsers
		- installs many other modules into node_modules (dependencies)
				
				
				
== React Project info ==
	- What gets generated inside the project directory
	
		"src" folder: Where all the scripts resides
			- "components" dir to contain all the component
				- App: root component to render all other component, then injected into index.html

			*.test.js: called when running tests
			
		scripts:
			- npm start: start react project in browser
			- npm build: Create production version (need another server to launch)
			- npm test: to use jest to run test on scripts
			- npm eject: removes all default packages to create own customized build
			
			
		"index.html" inside "public" dir:
			- <div id="root"></div> : Location where all components will be placed
			- inside index.js : root.render(<App />)
				- will look to App.js to look for info
				- all components will be inside App.js
				eg: 
				    <div className="App">
						<Header />
						<SearchBar term={search[0]} addTerm={appendHistory}/>
						<SearchHistory searches={search}/>
					</div>
		
		
		* Components are placed inside "src" dir
			- index.js : File where components are rendered
				- id="root" is targetted
					const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
					- will search in index.html for id="root"
				

== 2 methods to render components ==
				
				// Method 1:
				ReactDOM.render(
					<React.StrictMode> // React fragments to prevent HTML tag clutter
						<App />
					</React.StrictMode>,
					document.getElementById('root')
				);
				
				
				// Method 2:
				const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
				root.render(					
				<React.StrictMode> // React fragments to prevent HTML tag clutter
					<App />
				</React.StrictMode>
				);
				
				
- App.js : <App> component (root component)
	* Inside App component, any links (img / css files etc.) are imported
		- so that Webpack, after building project, knows where the files are located 
					

Creating production build:
	- files are more compress compared to dev build
		1) npm run build (build dir created)
		2) npx serve -s build (might need to install "serve" module)
			- files will be more compressed & optimized
			- no longer show components in React devtools in browser
