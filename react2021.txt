	React: JS library for building user interface
		- 2 main scripts that come with React
			1) "react" script
				- builds virtual DOM
				- describes all the UI components in app
				
			2) "react-dom" script
				- converts virtual DOM to actual HTML components on page
				
	ReactNative: 
		- "react" script & "react-native" script
		- converts virtual DOM to native components for ios & android 
		
	
	- Starting React Project -
		1) Create empty directory
		2) npx create-react-app <projectName> --use-npm / --use-yarn (optional)
			- gives: "react", "react-dom", "react-scripts"
				- "react-scripts": To help run production build for project
